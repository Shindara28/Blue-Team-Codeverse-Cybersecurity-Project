## Network Traffic Analysis Screenshots

These screenshots were captured during the process of tracking the attack team’s network activity. They document live packet analysis performed in Wireshark and reveal communication patterns between internal hosts and external servers observed during the engagement.

The packet captures include a mix of HTTP and HTTPS traffic, TLS-encrypted sessions, QUIC (HTTP/3) connections, as well as packet retransmissions and redirection behavior. Together, these elements helped in understanding how the attackers’ traffic traversed the network and interacted with various services.

By examining packet headers, protocol usage, and overall session behavior, the screenshots provide network-level evidence of the paths taken, the services accessed, and how both encrypted and unencrypted traffic were handled throughout the activity. This analysis was essential for tracing and reconstructing the actions of the attack team during the engagement.
