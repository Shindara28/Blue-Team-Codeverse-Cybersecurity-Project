These screenshots were captured during the process of tracking the attack team’s network activity. 
They show live packet analysis performed in Wireshark, revealing the communication patterns between internal hosts and external servers. 
The captures include HTTP and HTTPS traffic, TLS-encrypted sessions, QUIC (HTTP/3) connections, retransmissions, and redirection behavior, all of which helped in understanding how the attackers’ traffic moved across the network. 
By examining packet headers, protocol usage, and session behavior, the screenshots provide evidence of the paths taken, the services accessed, and how encrypted and unencrypted traffic was handled during the activity. 
Together, these images form part of the network-level evidence used to analyze and trace the actions of the attack team during the engagement.
