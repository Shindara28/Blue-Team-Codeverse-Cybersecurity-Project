## Network Traffic Analysis Screenshots

The included screenshots were captured during the monitoring of the attackers’ network activity. They illustrate live packet analysis conducted in Wireshark, highlighting communication between internal hosts and external servers throughout the engagement.

The packet captures show a combination of HTTP and HTTPS traffic, TLS-encrypted sessions, QUIC (HTTP/3) connections, as well as TCP retransmissions and redirection behaviors. These details provided insight into how the attackers’ traffic flowed across the network and interacted with various services.

By analyzing packet headers, protocol usage, and session behaviors, the screenshots serve as network-level evidence of the routes taken, the services accessed, and the handling of both encrypted and unencrypted traffic. This analysis was critical for reconstructing and understanding the attack team’s actions during the engagement.
