## Network Traffic Analysis Screenshots

The included screenshots were captured during the monitoring of the attackers’ network activity. They illustrate live packet analysis conducted in **Wireshark**, highlighting communication between internal hosts and external servers throughout the engagement.

The packet captures include a mix of **HTTP and HTTPS traffic**, **TLS-encrypted sessions**, **QUIC (HTTP/3) connections**, as well as **TCP retransmissions** and **redirection behaviors**. These details provide insight into how the attackers’ traffic traversed the network and interacted with various services.

By examining **packet headers**, **protocol usage**, and **session behaviors**, the screenshots serve as network-level evidence of the paths taken, the services accessed, and the handling of both encrypted and unencrypted traffic. This analysis was critical for reconstructing and understanding the attack team’s actions during the engagement.
